antibiotic susceptibilities

  cephalosporins
    1st generation
      staph and strep but no MRSA
      minimal gram-negative coverage
      cephalexin
      cefazolin
    2nd generation
      terrible for gram-positives
      better gram-negative coverage than 1st generation
      cefaclor
      cefuroxime
      cefotetan
    3rd generation
      moderate gram-positive coverage but not great
      good gram-negative coverage
      good CNS penetration
      ceftriaxone
        not good for Pseudomonas
      ceftazidime
        good for Pseudomonas
    4th generation
      as good as 1st generation for gram-positives
      excellent gram-negative coverage
        including Pseudomonas
      good CNS penetration
      cefepime

  fluoroquinolones
    2nd generation
      good gram-negative coverage
        including Pseudomonas
      poor gram-positive coverage
        covers SA but not pneumococcus
      ciprofloxacin
      ofloxacin
    3rd generation
      better gram-positive coverage than 2nd generation
        including pneumococcus
        better atypical coverage
      nearly as good gram-negative coverage as 2nd generation
      levofloxacin
    4th generation
      better gram-positive coverage than 3rd generation
        still need vancomycin if patient has MRSA
      similar gram-negative coverage to 3rd generation
      broad anaerobic coverage
      cover atypical mycobacteria
        common in post-LASIK infections
          M. fortuitum
          M. chelonae
      moxifloxacin
      gatifloxacin
