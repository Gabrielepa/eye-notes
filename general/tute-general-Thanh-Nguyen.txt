look at the examiner - even during a pause examining the patient

comment on general inspection
  exception may be posterior segment
  up down right left
  say
    eyes are white
    i can see a tube
    etc.
    just obvious
    don't bother with negatives because you might see something on SLE
  you must comment in general terms before they kill the lights for SLE

comment as you go
tell them what you're looking for even if negative
STOP after looking at the thing you're instructed to look at
  e.g. stop at anterior segment
be *brief* when you turn and say what you saw
  you are *done with the patient at this point
  *face the examiner and forget about the patient
offer a presumptive diagnosis
*then let them guide you
'what does this patient have to support your diagnosis?' type questions will come
*let the examiner go through their stuff
if your presumptive dx is wrong they will ask what else it could be
if you forget something - like you don't look at the disc say you would check it - 'in order to be certain i would check the appearance of the disc'
  if it's important they will let you look
  if not they might just tell you
if you state the findings as you go along
  they can feed it back to you if you forget to say it during your summary

IOP phasing is something they're really into with glaucoma

the ORDER matters - say the common thing first
people have failed for recognising PCV but not stating AMD is more common

you'll use up all your time if you give a 10 item differential

don't say findings are 'obvious' or 'the most striking thing' just state what you see.

comment on the details of the trab
*say wait 6/12 after trab

always look for guttae in any cataract station

be consistent if you ask for va and iop

5fu 50 mg/ml give 0.1 to preserve trab with any intraocular surgery
increased steroids with trab - say it

avoid 'if the patient had this...' the patient is right there talk about *this patient

0.4% phenyl from moorfields inject 0.1 - many consultants don't use it
say hooks, malyugin, the common stuff - phenyl minims not used here

they will generally say 'put on your indirect' - just have it on and be ready
with BIO just say
  clear media or not
  nerve and vessels look normal or not
    the disc is pink and doesn't appear cupped
  no obvious abnormality of the macula
  then start your peripheral exam
turn around and state your findings
  'i would like to examine the other eye'
  you can do this before you commit to a diagnosis

older patient with good vision with RP probably has AD!

legal driving field is 120˚ horizontally and 20˚ vertically
can't have 2 contigous missed points on the esterman within that 120˚

be friendly with the examiner - you don't have to be hyperconfident
short differentials and let them guide you

with uveitis/scleritis etc. don't go on a lengthy trip with investigations just the common things to rule out
say i would like to rule out by history and investigations, the following conditions:
then they can ask you OK what bloods would you order to do that
if they confirm a scary thing - say that it's scary
  'elevated ANCA would be consistent with granulomatosis with polyangiitis - this is a life threatening condition and needs to be comanaged with a physician. this patient will need systemic immunosuppression starting with steroids and transitioning to steroid sparing immunosuppression.'
  if you give systemic steroids
    qid bsl
    qid bp
    cover with omeprazole for reflux
  for every uveitis
    exclude infection
    topical
    periocular
    systemic

press on scleritis - if it's tender it may be active
fluorescein to look for leaks/perforation (sweating?)

every lid lesion
  say your preferred method of margin control
  say you need anterior and posterior lamellae - one of which needs a local blood supply
hughes is the common one so say that - postauricular
  say what you've seen in case they ask detail
  if you haven't seen it watch vids
for confirming dx just say 3mm punch biopsy under local anaesthesia in the centre of the lesion

ocular motility
  cover test
  then eye movements
if they say eye movement
  just launch into versions/ductions
not sure i understand this

don't give them a big target for motility
  just a couple lines above the smallest they can read
do your covers a couple times to confirm
just roughly comment
  small XT/ET/HT
  large XT/ET/HT
  they will ask if they want you to measure

get a good accom target and use it for motility
left eye adduction is preserved
left eye abduction is preserved
then right
  so 2 passes for each
  there is a lot to pick up on horizontal movement so you can't take in both eyes at once
  common critique is people go too fast
then up and down before you do the corners
  first without touching the lids
    yes or no on aberrant regeneration
  then lift the lids 2nd time
pass it between your hands rather than crossing your arm - looks more professional
again twice for the corners also with lid lift 2nd pass inferiorly
say as you go for each thing  - no aberrant regen, IOOA
again summarise your findings before you go further with diagnosis and management

review the types of X(t) including simulated
i need to assess if this is simulated or true 'tenacious proximal convergence' review this
occlusion of marlow is the patching for 45 min thing and then you don't let them fuse before you test for tpc look it up

thanh tute part deux

if you see a lesion on the lid
  comment
    is there punctal involvement
      must say this
  measure with a ruler

general view is that very few people use Cionni or CTS
  don't start talking fancy
  ok to close and refer to vr
  also ok to say that you are comfortable with a VR approach

aniridia is common on the exam - review

again - general inspection
  look up
  look down
  look right
  look left
  'the eyes are white'
  then to the slitlamp

patients with corneal dystrophies
  even stromal
  warn them about RCES and ellipt
  i would stain with fluorescein to ensure there is no epithelial defect or secondary infection
  this is essential to pass

just do fatiguability and let them tell you it's negative

practise saying gonioscopy in ant segment stations
  just practise it man
  say you would do IOP phasing to decide if it's NTG
  and say you would ask about migraine raynaud etc

review the bs vs ms noninfective causes

if you see corneal haze
  must always say fluorescein to ensure no epithelial defect
  must always say you would flip the lid

shield ulcer
  debride EUA
  say the exact drops
    PF lubricants
    Chlorsig qid
    Prednefrin Fort 2 hourly
  if the IOP is high on steroids
    change to cyclosporine 1% (SAS form)
