optic atrophy
  bilateral
  *short list

  still image optic neuropathy if there is NFL swelling in the context of disc drusen

peripheral field loss so comment on driving

disc swelling is not the same as optic atrophy in terms of ddx so decide which one you're going down

hospital exec
your own medical indemnity
clear and factual only medical documentation

esterman no more than 3 points total can be missed in the 120

management of disc drusen
  only intervention that might help is IOP lowering drops

people that failed didn't scan despite bilateral optic disc swelling
also consider embolic sources - aortic arch, PFO

orbit - mention corkscrew
always consider CCF and TED
review orbital apex lesions

7 ages of the orbit from atan plastics and orbit
need to say the top 3+ things for each age group
def review

if they say it's an 'orbit' exam don't make it a motility exam

bilateral lid procedures can just be done the same day

-----

quick review of systemic problems with homocystinuria, sulfite oxidase, and other causes of ectopic lens - blood clotting

review nonsurgical intervention for ectopic lens to sound conservative

briefly review diagnostic classification for marfan syndrome

subluxed lens in marfan you need to think about preop risk of RRD - LD, holes etc. and give him a good exam
also he needs counselling and assessment just along the lines of high myopia

when you get a cataract station of any kind
ask about biometry
  they want to show it to you
formula you would use
preop intraop postop

think about these high aniso cases
don't ever operate on a healthy eye just to correct aniso
you can target mod myopia and correct the fellow eye with a ctl

review classification of chemical injury - they will want you to grade it

every day with chemical injury
IOP
perf
superinfection
symblepharon
persistent epi defect

use roper hall on the race they don't know dua

apparently there are some people who do dmek so revise your notes it's ok to say

always talk about the implications or exam for the fellow eye

-----

review risk factors for PACG

review proper classification of PACD again

low threshold to revise a thin walled avascular bleb
always seidel them
mention risk of endophthalmitis if there is a leak

moorfields bleb grading system
there *will be at least 1 bleb in the 2 stations
look for failed blebs
review how to manage malfunctioning leaky and scarred blebs

'sweaty' bleb might get revised even if it's not frankly leaking
