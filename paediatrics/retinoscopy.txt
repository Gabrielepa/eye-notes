retinoscopy
  go minus until you have 'with' in all directions
  line up your streak with the reflex to get the axis
  neutralise that axis or the one 90˚ away by adding plus
    whichever is first
  make your power cross
    label the ˚ of both meridians
    label the power of the meridian you just neutralised
  neutralise 90˚ away
    label the power of that meridian
      in absolute terms
  write out the Rx
    use the difference between the two absolute powers for the cyl
    picture the direction the streak is oriented for that meridian
      that's your axis
      90˚ away
  -1.5 working distance from the sphere for final Rx
