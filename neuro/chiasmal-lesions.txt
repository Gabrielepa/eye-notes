chiasmal lesions

  DDx
    COMMON:
      pituitary adenoma
        if the onset of a bitemporal hemianopia is acute
          assume pituitary apoplexy OR suprasellar aneurysm
            hemorrhage into a preexisting pituitary adenoma
              severe HA
              mental status changes
              CN deficits
          ALWAYS: MRI
          labs
            prolactin
            GH
            ACTH
            TSH
          pituitary apoplexy is life threatening
            deficiency of all pituitary hormones
            cortisol deficiency is the most dangerous
            ADMIT for imaging and hormone replacement
            multidisciplinary
              endocrine
              neurosurgery
                may need decompression
          for isolated prolactinoma
            endocrine + neurosurgery to follow
              will usually start with bromocriptine
              may need transsphenoidal decompression
                progressive vision loss OR VF loss despite medical therapy
    ALSO:
      meningioma
      craniopharyngioma
      suprasellar ICA aneurysm
    RARELY:
      TB
      lyme
      sarcoid
      MS

  hemifield slide phenomenon
    loss of overlapping ganglion cell receptive fields
      from corresponding areas of nasal and fellow temporal retina
    loss of fusion
    inability to suppress a natural phoria
    then becomes a tropia
    causes diplopia

  post-fixational blindness
    temporal visual field gives stereo context to objects beyond fixation
    bitemporal hemianopia causes post-fixational blindness
      images beyond fixation fall on the temporal visual field
    exacerbated by hemifield slide

  band atrophy
    fibres responsible for the nasal macula
      enter straight into the nerve via the PMB
    fibres from the nasal peripheral retina
      enter straight into the nasal aspect of the disc
    fibres from the temporal macula and temporal retina
      sweep into the superior and inferior poles of the disc
    compression the decussating nasal fibres in the chiasm
      causes atrophy at 0300 & 0900
      results in a bowtie or band atrophy pattern
    if the optic tract is involved
      there may be bowtie atrophy on the contralateral side AND
      diffuse atrophy OR vertical bowtie atrophy on the ipsilateral side

  VF patterns
    COMMON: bitemporal hemianopia
    ALSO:
      bitemporal superior quadrantanopia
      bitemporal inferior quadrantanopias
      unilateral temporal hemianopia
      junctional scotoma
        compression at the junction of the nerve and chiasm
        central field loss on the affected side
          small scotoma up to complete VF defect
        ST defect in the fellow eye
