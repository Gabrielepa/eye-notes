anterior uveitis
  risk of visual impairment doubles @ SUN 0.5+ WBC versus SUN 0

intermediate uveitis
  1˚ cause of visual loss is CME
  if no CME
    may observe
  treatment
    regional
      periocular
      intravitreal
        100% incidence of cataract after 5 IVT
      100% recurrence of CME with regional alone
        so nearly always use systemic
    systemic

Jabs prednis(ol)one regimen
  1 mg/kg/d 60- mg max
    60+ mg greatly increases the risk of ischemic necrosis of bone
  taper after 2-4 weeks
    if you can't taper
      SSIMT
  goal
    SUN 0
    under 7.5 mg/kg/d
  Jabs does not use prophylactic PPI
    NSAIDs cause PUD
      steroids potentiate NSAID-associated ulceration
      steroids alone have low risk of PUD
    PPI increases the risk of osteoporosis
  calcium + vitamin D is an optional adjunct
    per Jabs
      calcium alone may increase the risk of MI
    most sources I read say MI risk is slightly increased ± vitamin D
  weigh your patients
    Hawthorne effect
      measured behavior is modified behavior
  taper
    60-40 -10 mg/(week OR 2 days if rapid)
    40-20 -5 mg
    20-10 -2.5 mg
    10- -2.5-1 mg

monitoring SSIMT
  bloods 4-6 weeks

start SSIMT at diagnosis
    COMMON:
      JIA
      MC ± P
      BSCR
      VKH

choice of agent
  mycophenolate OR MTX
  efficacy
    mycophenolate > MTX
    cyclosporine has poor efficacy
  tolerance
    mycophenolate > azathioprine
    cyclosporine is poorly tolerated

mycophenolate
  2-3 g daily
    divided bd
  diarrhea
    less if you ramp up slowly
  in children // see Doycheva, BJO 2016
    225 mg/m2 bd x 1 weeks
    then 450 mg/m2 bd
    ± prednisolone 1 mg/kg/d
      taper
        10 mg/week to 30 mg/d
        5 mg/week to 20 mg/d
        2.5 mg/week to 0 mg/d

cyclosporine
  avoid in psoriasis
    these patients are often on PUVA OR topical cyclosporine
    po cyclosporine potentiates PUVA and topical cyclosporine skin cancer risks

alkylating agents
  cyclophosphamide
  chlorambucil
  avoid in the young
    especially for duration 2+ years
  high risk of cancer
    COMMON: nonmelanotic skin cancer
    all agents have some risk but this class is the worst

TNFI
  use first line for Behcet
  COMMON: in combination
    MTX
    mycophenolate
  if using TNFI in intermediate uveitis
    ALWAYS: MRI
      TNFI make MS worse
  hard to taper
    Foster BSCR data indicates they may need treatment for life
  increased nonmelanotic skin cancer

once SSIMT initiated
  treat 3+ y regardless of activity
  treat 2+ y inactive
  data is from a study in JIA

if SSIMT is inadequate but not ineffective
  add a 2nd agent
  you may be able to lower the dose of 1 or both once controlled
