Retisert implant

– pre-place 8-0 prolene that comes with the implant and tie an overhand knot to secure implant halfway along it. Throughout the surgery only handle the implant by the suture tab.
– 90 degree conj peritomy in one of the 2 inferior quadrants per surgeon preference.
– place PP infusion in a different quadrant if eye previously vitrectomised.
– 3.5 mm circumferential incision mid-quadrant with 20 g MVR blade at a distance of 3.5 mm from the limbus.
– confirm incision full thickness by opening with forceps.
– vitrect at opening.
– place implant through the opening with medication 'button' facing anteriorly.
– pass the 2 ends of the double-armed prolene out each side of the incision, tie and cut the ends LONG. Make sure the wound closes completely and the strut of the implant is completely inside the wound & not trapped.
– close the remainder of the incision with interrupted 9-0 prolene, trapping the long ends of the 8-0 as you go.
– bury the knots of the 9-0 and trim the 8-0. Ensure there is no vitreous prolapse with a weck.
– repressurize the eye with BSS via PP infusion or PP 30 g needle if needed.
– close conjunctiva with 6-0 plain gut.
– examine with indirect to ensure good placement.
