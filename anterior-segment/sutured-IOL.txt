revamped method for sutured IOL:

GoreTex CV-8 (7-0 equivalent)
  46 cm length
  TTc-7 is the smallest needle
    but you will cut it off anyway

apply OVD to the cornea
  refresh as needed
360 peritomy
hemostasis superiorly
3 port PPV setup
  place your ports carefully
    infusion
      low enough to avoid suture holes
      high enough to allow torting eye downward for the frownie incision
    other trochars
      high enough to avoid suture holes
      low enough to avoid superior frownie incision
complete PPV
  ensure PVD
  remove any capsular remnant
  shave vitreous base
frownie incision @ 12
  2 mm from the limbus at the apex
  width appropriate for lens
    B & L Akreos AO60 (hydrophilic acrylic)
      4.5 mm
    Alcon CZ70BD (PMMA)
      external 6 mm
      internal 7.5 mm
  stay intracorneal for now
create suture holes
  2 x 0300
  2 x 0900
  2 mm from the limbus
  enter parallel to iris plane
  use 15Ëš blade
    internal os is much smaller than an MVR incision
    allows rotation of knot but usually does not need suturing
  better to make them further apart
    makes suture rotation easier
    avoid compression of Akreos haptics
    for now say about 3 mm
      adjust this as you do these
open suture
  cut off needles
  cut in half
open lens
  transfer to the operating field
thread sutures through haptics
  CZ70BD
    run both sides of suture in front of the haptic
  Akreos
    run both sides of suture front to back
enter AC using a 3 mm keratome blade
  widen incision as above
pass sutures
  1 at a time
  into the AC with a tying forcep
  retrieve via your suture holes with a VR forcep
  inferior suture before superior suture on each side
take the slack out of the sutures
pass the IOL into the AC
  CZ70BD
    simply pass with a tying forcep and hold the wound with a toothed forcep
  Akreos
    hold along the long axis with a tying forcep
    fold along the long axis with a folding forcep
      0300 and 0900 sutures stay on their respective sides
        rather than touching each other
    grasp with delivery forcep to deliver to the AC
take the slack out of the sutures
slide the suture a bit on each side
  to ensure that the suture moves freely and is not bound around the haptic
  so you know you can bury the knot later
tie each side
  Akreos is not that long
    use slipknots
    centre before tying off
tuck the knot into the sclera with a tying forcep
  trim the ends flush with the sclera
suture the frownie incision with interrupted 10-0 nylon
close the conjunctiva with 6-0 plain gut
  take episcleral bites at the limbus
