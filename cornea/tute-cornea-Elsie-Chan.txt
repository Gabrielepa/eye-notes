  mild case
  don't say form fruste on the exam just say mild
  let's say they're going for PKE/IOL
    qualify use of a toric
      assumes STABLE refraction
  astig is upper R on pentacam - look at K1 K2 and amount of astig
  options for big astig
    lenstar/iolmaster ks
    sometimes just use central 3 mm
    read on this - options for Ks in toric IOLs with irreg astig/ectasia
  pt who is looking at a future graft
    central Ks 2-3 mm if ectasia is off centre
    common: use average ks
    or: just use their own ks
    55- use patients Ks with target of low myopia (moorfields)
    55+ use standard Ks
    43.25 standard ks = moorfields
      Irving Raber at Wills says 45-47
        if you later need to do a graft you can get 45-47
        oversize 0.25 mm for 45
        oversize 0.5 mm for 47
  caveats: very hard to fit rgp ctl over toric IOL! go spherical if any question
photo - corneal crystals
  crystalline keratopathy
    Bietti
    cystinosis
    drugs e.g. tamoxifen
    make a longer list here
    medical workup for corneal crystals and treatment workup of cystinosis
epithelial ingrowth
  look at pics of this
  lift the flap and ablate with alcohol if visually significant/progressive
specular microscopy of guttae
  look at pics
  how would you assess and manage FED going for PKE/IOL
  review history elements of FED in addition to objective
photo granular dystrophy
  be sequential
  history
  family members and family history
  review treatment algorithm from least to most aggressive
geographic hsv ulcer in a corneal graft
  no systemic steroids in graft rejection
    no evidence this really helps
  delay topical steroids until (nearly) epithelialised - qualify this
  if patient get recurrence of hsv in a graft while on acyclovir
    check for acyclovir resistance testing
  note she didn't admit the patient with geographic ulcer in a graft
    but they weren't frankly rejecting in the photo
  review HEDS again
anterior segment OCT of KCN with hydrops
  look for the descemet tear
  look at more photos
photo of large limbal dermoid
  management of dermoid and subsequent amblyopia
complete corneal opacification with vessels
  bilateral
  in this case LSCD 2Ëš aniridia
  review signs of LSCD - tim went right for LSCD when he saw the vessels
  always start with your systemic assessment - FH, workup for WAGR etc before leaping into surgical options/grafting.
photo of subluxed lens
  review a *short DDx
  always ask about trauma in addition to the systemic diseases
  it's OK to say you would refer the patient to a physician for marfan/homocystinuria etc. type workups - you need to know generally to look for these things but don't obsess about the workup details
photo of MMP
  SAY that you would refer the patient on to a physician for these workups
  start with your *short DDx and then pursue your workup and treatment for the common thing - that way they can redirect you if you mention the right thing early but aren't pursuing it
photo of OSSN at limbus
  establish diagnosis
    impression cytology-based decision making - review this
    talk about topical chemoreduction first
    avoid penetrating bowman layer - forms a natural barrier
    use the right words
      margin control
      no touch dry technique
        look this up
      cryo double freeze thaw
      MMC
      alcohol on the corneal epithelial side helps to prevent you from disrupting bowman
photo severe neoplasm over entire ocular surface - this one was SCC
  even when it's terrible looking
  first confirm diagnosis and *extent of lesion - don't rush to intervention at the beginning
    biopsy
    SCAN
    lymph nodes
    physician/oncologist
HPV papilloma mimicking OSSN - photo is actually recurrence - heavy cryo can help if they keep coming back
PUK @ inferior limbus - just review how you would work patient up and manage
  use the term 'optimising ocular surface' and then say under that umbrella what you would do
  if they say systemic disease is controlled but the thinning is progressive - systemic therapy is not adequate and must be increased
old RK incisions
  talk through rehabilitating these patients when they slip
  specs
  CTL
  DALK
    the patient in question had a messy topography so you need to intervene in the cornea if the vision is poor - RLE and phakic ICL are not really options here
khodadoust rejection line on a graft
  how would you manage - go
  MORE discussion of the role of systemic steroids - read up on their role in rejection
    not a lot of evidence this helps per elsie
    she says IVMP is OK and you can mention it but you need to qualify that evidence is thin
necrotising scleritis
  make sure you specifically mention surgery/trauma as a cause rather than just running wild with autoimmune
  say 'autoimmune' or 'infectious' and just give a *couple examples from each category - nice if they are the most common ones
  dark areas - mention possibility of extrascleral extension of an intraocular tumour - BSUS will help with this - this is a secondary concern though not the primary concern so mention later in the list.
Terrien - note the opacities on the corneal side of the thinning that is really helpful - little white things go over pictures again. it's lipid.
VKC
  mention cyclosporine in addition
  list in order
  lube
  mast cell
  steroids in acute exac
  cyclosporine
  then supratarsal if poorly controlled or shield ulcer
  very rarely will need systemic treatment
