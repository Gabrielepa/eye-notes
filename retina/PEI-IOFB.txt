IOFB

  essential history
    mechanism
      high velocity
        machinery
        metal-on-metal
        more likely to have small IOFB that are hard to detect
    composition
      most inflammatory
        pure aluminium
        copper
        iron
        zinc
      chronic inflammation
        copper alloys 85-% elemental copper
          brass
          bronze
          chronic chalcosis
            Wilson-like peripheral Descemet deposition
            sunflower cataract
            metallic ILM flecks
        iron
          chronic siderosis
            oxidative damage
              iris
                heterochromia
              lens
                cataract
              retina
                RAPD
                ON pallor
                pigmentary retinopathy
                reduced ERG b-wave
              RPE
    how recent?
    risk factors for endophthalmities after PEI
      rural location
      disruption of the lens
        effectively a unicameral eye
        lens protein may nourish bacteria
      tissue prolapse
      organic IOFB
      delayed primary closure
        24+ hours
          4x greater risk of infection

  ocular trauma scoring
    include all of these in your documentation
      can't score unless you've documented all factors
    lose points for
      rupture
      RAPD
      endophthalmitis
      RRD
      perforation
    gain points for
      VA
        up to 100 for 6/12+
    convert total of points into an OTS category
      1 is the worst prognosis
        3/4 NPL
      5 is the best prognosis
        nearly all 6/12+

  essential decision points
    lens and capsule status
    retinal status
    infection versus sterile inflammation

  IOFB is a subset of PEI
    observe TICS
      tetanus
      IV antibiotics
        IV vancomycin + ceftazidime 1 g each q 12/24 OR
        a 4th generation quinolone such as IV moxifloxacin OR
        po cipro 500-750 mg bd x 7-10/7 (RVEEH protocol)
        ± voriconazole 200 mg IV OR po q 12/24
      CT scan
        IOFB
        bony fractures
        orbital compartment syndrome
      shield

  indications for early PPV
    poor VA in fellow eye
    corneal decompensation
    torn lens capsule
      cataract with intact capsule may benefit from delay
        to get proper biometry
    endophthalmitis
      sterile OR
      infectious
        Bacillus spp.
        GPC
        fungal
    VH precluding adequate assessment of the retina
    ambiguous BSUS findings
    mac-on RRD OR
    progressive VR traction

    removed via PP OR
    tunneled CS incision
      rare-earth magnet
      FB forceps
    prophylactic antibiotics
      always consider
      mandatory for organic matter
        vancomycin
        ceftazidime
        ± amphotericin B

  monitor the fellow eye for SO
  leave corneal sutures in ~ 3/12

  serial ERG if any question of retained iron
