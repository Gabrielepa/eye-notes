  Questions:
    What is the most likely explanation for the findings?
    If I told you this patient had inferior SRF causing the pigmentary change, what would your differential be?
    What ancillary testing or investigations do you want and why?
      (peripheral exam)
      BP
      OCT
      BSUS
      FFA
    If this patient has posterior scleritis, what findings might you expect on ultrasound?


  RRD demarcation line
    this is the sort of patient you actually get on RACE
      not an active RRD
    general to specific
      This is a patient with inferior RPE atrophy and RPE hypertrophy in the macula.
      This would be consistent with a demarcation from prior SRF.

  This 75 year-old male was referred for gradual vision loss due to cataracts.
  Please examine the lens and posterior pole of each eye, and comment on any further investigation you might want.

  The patient does have cataract.
    symmetric
      3+ NS
    VA asymmetric
      clues like this all over the RACE.

  They should comment on the discs.

  Ask about plaquenil numbers even though it's not that.
