choroidal and retinal neoplasms

pigmented fundus lesion DDx
  RPE hypertrophy
  CHRPE
  hemorrhage
  naevus
  melanoma
  melanocytoma
  simple RPE hamartoma
    RARE
    usually congenital
  combined hamartoma
  RPE adenoma
    high IR
    feeding artery
    draining vein
  RPE adenocarcinoma

choroidal melanoma

  risk factors for choroidal melanoma
    caucasian
    fair skin
      tendency to sunburn
    freckled skin
      marker of sun exposure
    light eyes
    iris naevi
    uv exposure
      outdoor activities
      arc welding
    symptoms
    growth
    thickness 2+ mm
    within 3 mm of the nerve
    no drusen
    no halo
    orange pigment
    SRF
    BSUS
      acoustic hollowness
        naevus is homogeneous
      low-medium IR
        naevus medium+ IR
      choroidal excavation
      orbital shadowing
      spontaneous vascular pulsations
    may need to follow several years to distinguish

      Thickness 2+ mm
      Fluid
      Symptoms
      Orange pigment
      Margin within 3 mm of disc
      Ultrasound Hollowness
      Halo absent
      Drusen absent
      2+ risk factors
        half will grow
          presumed melanoma
        probably treat
        ultimately clinician judgement based on full picture

  COMS study
    medium tumors
      2.5-10 mm thick
      5-16 mm in diameter
      equal survival rates for I125 and enucleation
    large tumors
      equal survival rates whether you radiated before enucleation or not

combined hamartoma of the retina and RPE
  associations
    NF2
  diagnosis
    may have a vascular component
      vascular tortuosity is out of proportion to traction
      FFA helps to distinguish from melanocytoma
    glial component is rarely seen in melanocytoma
  treatment
    you can't peel the ERM because it's glial tissue integrated with the retina

subretinal infiltrates in a leopard skin pattern
  lymphoma

choroidal mets
  pigment clumping
    leopard spot appearance

choroidal folds
  THIN RPE
    tumors
    hypotony
    inflammation
    idiopathic
    neovascular membrane
    retrobulbar mass
    papilledema
    extraocular hardware
      juxtascleral
        SB
      orbital
  for most purposes
    shorten this list to HIM
      hypotony
      inflammation
        scleritis
      mechanical
        SB
        orbital mass
        TED

choroidal osteoma
  usually PP
  orange-red => yellow white as overlying RPE loses pigment
  look for small vascular networks on the tumor surface
  BSUS
    highly reflective
  if SRF
    PDT
      any SRF
    antiVEGF
      SRF 2Ëš CNV
